Subject: Re: Potential Bank Impersonation Fraud Attempt
Dear Emily Johnson,

Thank you for bringing this concerning incident to our attention. We take the security of our customers' accounts very seriously and are committed to addressing this matter promptly.

Based on the details you have provided, it appears that this was indeed an attempt at bank impersonation fraud. Our bank would never contact a customer in this manner, demanding sensitive information over the phone. This is a common tactic used by scammers to trick individuals into disclosing confidential data.

We appreciate that you did not share any personal or financial information with the caller. This was the right decision, as it helps to protect your account from potential misuse.

To further address this issue, we kindly request that you provide us with the phone number used by the caller, as well as any other relevant details you may have. Our security team will investigate this incident and take the necessary steps to prevent similar fraudulent attempts in the future.

In the meantime, we recommend that you closely monitor your account for any suspicious activity and immediately report any unauthorized transactions to us. Additionally, please be vigilant of any unsolicited calls, emails, or messages requesting sensitive information, as these are often signs of attempted fraud.

We are here to support you and ensure the security of your account. Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any other questions or concerns.

Sincerely,
John Smith
