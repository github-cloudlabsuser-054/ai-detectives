Subject: Urgent: Potential Bank Impersonation Fraud Attempt
Dear Bank Customer Service,

I am writing to report a concerning incident that occurred earlier today. I received a phone call from a person claiming to be a representative from your bank, stating that there had been suspicious activity on my account and that I needed to verify my personal and financial information immediately.

The caller was very insistent and used high-pressure tactics, claiming that if I did not provide the requested information, my account would be frozen. They provided a phone number that appeared to be associated with your bank, further adding to the legitimacy of the call.

However, I became suspicious of the situation and did not share any sensitive details. I am concerned that this may be a case of bank impersonation fraud, and I wanted to bring this to your attention right away.

Please advise on the authenticity of this call and the necessary steps I should take to protect my account. I appreciate your prompt assistance in addressing this matter.

Sincerely,
Emily Johnson
